T-Mobile customer service is terrible. Waiting on hold for 30 minutes!
"Love T-Mobile coverage in my area, very reliable."
My bill is way too high this month. Not happy.
"Great service, fast internet. Thank you T-Mobile!"
Dropped calls all the time. Coverage is awful.
"Customer support was helpful today, solved my issue quickly."
Hidden fees on my bill again… very frustrated.
"Excellent network, no complaints."
"Slow internet speed in downtown area, disappointed."
"T-Mobile made switching easy, very satisfied with service."
